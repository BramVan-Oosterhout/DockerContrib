---++ Fast start
If you don't like reading documentation, and just want a fast route to running a Foswiki site, then: 

   1 Make sure docker is installed and running
   1 Download the tar ball for DockerInstallContrib  and save it in your home directory
   2 Untar the tar ball
   3 cd to the tools directory in the created directory tree
   4 =perl docker-install.pl timlegge -build=
      * You will be asked to specify a passwordr for the Foswiki =admin= login
   5 In your browser access http://localhost:&lt;listed port>
   6 Use your Foswiki

---++ Using DockerInstallContrib

DockerInstallContrib is an entry point to a collection of Docker Foswiki implementations. The =docker-install= utility will download a definition from a repository and start a container based on the provided image.  To maintain the image and container collection you must be familiar with and use the =docker= script as documented at https://docs.docker.com/.

=DockerInstallContrib= *does not need a Foswiki installation*. One can clone DockerInstallContrib from GitHub and proceed from there.

Or, if it is included on =foswiki.org=, download the =DockerInstallContrib.tgz= tar ball, untar and proceed from there. No local =Foswiki= installation required. And one can read the description of =DockerInstallContrib= at =foswiki.org/Extensions/DockerInstallContrib=.


To use this extension, navigate to the tools directory
<verbatim>
cd tools
sudo perl docker-install,pl <foswiki install>
</verbatim>

---++ docker-install script

The docker-install script  accepts the following options:
| *Parameter* | *Description* | *Default* |
| &lt;foswiki install> | The name of the Docker Foswiki contribution you want to install|  |
| -type | The type of container you want to install | =default= |
| -build | Build the image from the Dockerfile before installation | -nobuild |
| -verbose | Display the output of the commands issued. | -noverbose |

The current implementation supports two contributions:
| *Source* | *Description* |
| bram | A demonstration of an application =NoyepadApp built with the wiki workbemch |
| timlegge | A maintained collection of images described at:  https://github.com/timlegge/docker-foswiki. <br /> Two of the four images available can be installed with =docker-install= : =simple= and =simple-https= <br />This is the most complete and maintained Docker Foswiki image implementation. |
| dieken | A plain Foswiki image that can be started either under =apache (CGI)= or =nginx (FCGI)= |
